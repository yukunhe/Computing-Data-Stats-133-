####Some Exercises on Regex & Function definition####

# Write a function called unexclaim. Your function should take the following
# arguments
#   <chstring>: a character vector of length 1 (contains only one string).
#
# and return the following
#   <newstring>: a character vector of length 1 where all ! symbols have been
#     replaced by . symbols
unexclaim <- function(chstring) {
  return(gsub('!', '.', chstring))
}


# Write a function called updateDate. Your function should take the following
# arguments
#   <dates>: a character vector of dates of the form "month, year" (e.g. "May, 2001")
#   <old.yr>: a string indicating the year for which elements will be updated
#     (e.g. "2002")
#
# and return the following
#   <updated.dates>: a character vector of dates where <old.yr> has been replaced by
#     '2015'. This vector should only contain the elements whose date has been
#     updated. For example updateDate(c('May, 2010', 'June, 2011'), '2010') should
#     return 'May, 2015'.
updateDate <- function(dates, old.yr) {
  
  old.yr.idcs <- grep(old.yr, dates)
  new.dates <- gsub(old.yr, '2015', dates[old.yr.idcs])
  return(new.dates)
}


# Write a function called countcatdog that counts the number of instances of
# "cat" (case-insensitive) and the number of instances of "dog"
# (case-insensitive) in a string. Your function should take the following
# arguments 
#   <chvec>: A character vector of length 1 (chvec contains only 1 string)
#
# and return the following
#   <counts>: An integer vector of length 2 with names "cat" and "dog".
#             For example, countcatdog("doGCATcat abcAt") returns:
#                    cat dog
#                     3   1
countcatdog<- function(chvec){
  
  chvec <- tolower(chvec)
  
  num.cat <- 0
  num.dog <- 0
  ind.cat <- gregexpr("cat", chvec)[[1]]
  ind.dog <- gregexpr("dog", chvec)[[1]]
  
  if(ind.cat[1] != -1) num.cat <- length(ind.cat)
  if(ind.dog[1] != -1) num.dog <- length(ind.dog)
  counts <- c(cat = num.cat, dog = num.dog)
  return(counts)
}
